# Lightweight Java Sourcemodding Tool

## What

A sourcemodding tool written in Java for all operating systems (that support Java).

## Why

Because there are tons of great tools for sourcemodding... for Windows. So I made this one for all operating systems

## What doesn't it / won't it have?

- A map editor: see openhammer
- A texture editor: get a plugin for your favourite image manipulation program
- A map decompiler: see bspsrc
- that's literally it it will have everything else
